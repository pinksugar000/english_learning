一、表语

表语紧跟系动词之后的结构，表述主语的身份、状态、性质等信息

系动词的作用是联系前后的两个结构
以下是常用的系动词：
am/is/are (be动词)	keep	seem	appear
become	feel	get		grow	remain	
smell	look	sound	stay	taste
感官动词？

I keep silent in class.

I keep books in my room.

系动词后面可以跟名词，还可以跟形容词
系动词替换成be动词后，语义基本不变

I am slient in class.

I am books in my room.  (x)

二、什么是定语和状语

形容词：修饰名词或代词，一般翻译成"...的"

The cute boy speaks english.

定语是广义的形容词，在一些情景中，使用介词短语和定语从句来表达更丰富的语义

The boy in red speaks english.

The boy whom i played with speaks english.


副词：修饰除名词和代词外的其他结构，如动词、形容词、短语、句子等

James answered quickly.

状语是广义的副词，在一些情景中，使用介词短语和定语从句来表达更丰富的语义

James answered in english.

When i had no idea,James answered.


三、什么是补语

补语是对宾语的补充说明

1.中文的补语

中文中的，有一类动词可以改变宾语的动作或状态，如：

"我要求学生们去跳舞。"
"小明请我看电影。"

宾补：对宾语变化后的动作或状态做补充说明

去掉宾补

"我要求学生们。"
"小明请我。"

补语是句子中不可省略的部分

去掉原句中的主语和谓语，保留宾语和宾补

"学生们去跳舞。"
"我看电影。"

宾语和宾补可以组成一个完整的句子，且该句所表达的信息与原句基本相同

"战士们击败了敌人鼓舞了民众的信心。"

"敌人鼓舞了民众的信心。"	（x）

2.英语

英语中可以改变宾语的动作和状态的动词
ask(要求)	find(发现)	make(使得)	have（使得、把）see(看到) 	hear(听到)	
watch(看着)	want(要求)

They have no habit of smoking.

I have my hair dyed.

英语中宾补的特点和中文类似：
a.	补语是句子中不可缺省的部分
b.	宾语和补语之间加入be动词后可以构成一个完整的句子，且该句所表达的信息与原句基本相同

I ask students to learn english.

I ask students.

Students were to learn english.


补语的构成原理：
补语是由名词从句省略得到

I found that the homework was difficult.

I found the homework difficult.

She herad that jean was singing.

She heard jean singing.

表语的结构一定可以做补语，即名词和形容词都可以做补语

eg:
I saw his face reflected in the water.

四、单词的词性

词性

eg:
more 
adv. 更多；此外；更大程度地
adj. 更多的；附加的
pron. 更多的数量

We had more than they did.

五、关于"used"

used
adj. 习惯的；二手的；使用过的
v. 用；过去常做(used to)

I am used  表语

+介词短语

I am used to hot days.

I am used to having healthy diets.

I am used to what the world is like.

People are used to something ugly.

//
